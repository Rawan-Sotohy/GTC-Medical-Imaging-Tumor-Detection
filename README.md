# GTC Medical Imaging Tumor Detection

📌 Description

Brain tumor diagnosis from medical images is time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This project develops a deep learning model that automatically classifies MRI scans as **tumor** or **no tumor**, helping doctors speed up detection and reduce misdiagnosis.
