# GTC Medical Imaging Tumor Detection

üìå Description

Brain tumor diagnosis from medical images is time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This project develops a deep learning model that automatically classifies MRI scans as **tumor** or **no tumor**, helping doctors speed up detection and reduce misdiagnosis.

# üß† Brain Tumor MRI DataSet

This dataset has 2 files train and test each classify brain MRI images into four categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary**
- **No Tumor**

The dataset comes from Kaggle.

## How to Run

### 1. Get the Notebook
- Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
- Upload the notebook file with (`.ipynb`).

### 2. Get Kaggle API Token
- Go to your [Kaggle Account Settings](https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account).
- Scroll down to **API** and click **Create New API Token**.
- This will download a file called `kaggle.json`.

### 3. Upload `kaggle.json` to Colab
- In the notebook, run the first cell (it will ask you to upload the file).
- This allows the notebook to download the dataset automatically.

### 4. Install Dependencies
- Make sure to install the required Python libraries:

### 5. Spliting Data
- We split the train file into a training set and validation set while the test set is the same file as it is

### 6. Resizing and Normalizing
- We make sure it is Grayscale by forcing it to be 1 Channel and we resize the file to be (128*128) then we change the PIL images to Arrays using toTensor() to do the normalization

### 7. Checking Range 
- We make sure the sets are with a range of [0,1]

### 8. Data Augmentation
We apply slight brightness adjustment, horizontal flipping, and random rotation within ¬±15¬∞

## üß™ Model Training

We experimented with different models for **brain tumor classification**:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ SVM on Extracted Features
- **Input:** Flattened features from images  
- **Scaling:** StandardScaler  
- **Kernel:** Linear  
- **Test Accuracy:** **0.65**  
- **Strengths:** Fast to train, simple baseline  
- **Weaknesses:** Limited performance compared to CNNs  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CNN from Scratch
- **Input Size:** 128√ó128√ó3  
- **Architecture:**  
  - 2√ó Conv2D layers + MaxPooling  
  - 1√ó Dense(128) + Dropout(0.5)  
- **Epochs:** 10  
- **Test Accuracy:** **0.9550**  
- **Classification Report:**
  - Glioma ‚Üí Precision: 0.92, Recall: 0.94, F1: 0.93  
  - Meningioma ‚Üí Precision: 0.92, Recall: 0.88, F1: 0.90  
  - No Tumor ‚Üí Precision: 0.98, Recall: 1.00, F1: 0.99  
  - Pituitary ‚Üí Precision: 1.00, Recall: 0.98, F1: 0.99  

- **Strengths:** Simple, relatively fast, very high accuracy  
- **Weaknesses:** May not generalize as well to much larger/complex datasets

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
- **Input Size:** 128√ó128√ó3  
- **Pretrained on:** ImageNet  
- **Trainable Layers:** Top classifier only  
- **Epochs:** 10  
- **Test Accuracy:** **0.8769**  
- **Strengths:** Lightweight, efficient, reasonable accuracy  
- **Weaknesses:** Lower performance than custom CNN on this dataset
